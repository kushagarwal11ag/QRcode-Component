## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Centering components took some time, although I was aware that using flexbox solves these issues, I was stuck because not giving height to the component.

The final thing I learned was to add Google fonts without downloading any files!
This the font I used and how I added and implemented them in my project.

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');

body {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

This project was quite simple and pretty straight forward.
I'm hoping to build more complex projects in the future.
